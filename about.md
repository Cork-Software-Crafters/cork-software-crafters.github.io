We want to build a community around passionate developers, interested in improving their technical skills, in discussing and sharing their knowledge with their peers.

This is all about "learning by doing": Coding Dojos, Architectural Katas, Mob sessions, moderated discussions, ...

We value:
- Practical, concrete discussions on code over generic talks.
- Solutions applicable in any language over vendor-specific tool marketing.
- Exchange of ideas in an open environment over passive listening.
- Learning by practising with peers over hearing and forgetting.
